                    Men have often deserted God only to return in their times of
                    need for His attention. Most of these seekers have seldomly
                    moved God to minister to them because they don't have a good
                    track record of relationship with Him. Let us realize that
                    God is the Father of all flesh and as natural father require
                    relationship to work things out, so does He. Eph. 4:6, Heb.
                    12:9. If God gave you His name (Prov. 18:10), then he is
                    willing to establish you but is waiting on you to motivate
                    through a tight relationship.

                        King Ahab paid no attention to God in his entire life;
                        rather he lived a life of ungodly pursuit of selfish
                        ambition. Consequently he lost his life and lineage to
                        God's anger. Let us turn from Ahab‚Äôs ways and that he
                        imbibed from Jeroboam and save our lives. God is not
                        interested in the sacrifice of evil wealth but your
                        obedient relationship.
